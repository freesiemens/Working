This directory contains ChemCam read libray for reading .dat and EDR's 
and may eventually be updated for RAW files

Currently works for FSW R10.3 files. (1/20/2012)
example in data directory.

To test run the fillowing:

idl
filename='data/CL0_404858033EDR_F0010044CCAM00030M1.DAT'
defsysv,'!ChemCam_sdata','./' 
!path='.:'+expand_path('+/n/projects/chemcam/dot/tools/readdata')+':'+!path
spectra=ccam_read_libs_edr(filename,label_info=label_info,HK_prt=hk_prt)


___________________-

label_info is the information taken from the EDR label that will be passed on to the RDR label
There will soon be RDR write routines that should be called for writing the RDR's.
